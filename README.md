# AlarmApp 🔔⏰️🏋️‍♂️

A React Native alarm app designed for gym workouts and fitness routines, with background notifications and location tracking.

## Features

- ⏰ Customizable alarms for workout timers
- 🔔 Push notifications via Firebase
- 📍 Location-based triggers (optional)
- 📳 Vibration and wake lock for reliable alarms
- 🔄 Background service for persistent alarms
- 📱 Cross-platform (Android & iOS)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- React Native development environment ([Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment))
- Android Studio or Xcode
- Firebase project ([Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/))

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add an Android app with package name `com.alarmappnew`.
3. Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`.
4. Enable Firebase Messaging in the console.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

#### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

### Step 4: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
